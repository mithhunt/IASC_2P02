Bio:

I am a designer, artist, and student of Digital Humanities, Studying at Brock University and going into my third year with a major in Interactive Arts and Science (IASC). My focus and passion is within the digital expression concentration. My art and design portfolio shows competency within that area. To continue advancement of my skills, I am looking toward research regarding technical art and graphic/experience design. For example, the academic blog that I have written in response to proposed new methods of graphing temporal data. For the future I would like to take a further academically minded look into the ways which technology has expanded human expression, and where might it be headed. I want to research the many questions I could ask about the democratization of media creation tools and knowledge, technology in conjunction with open platforms. The projects presented as part of this portfolio are representative of a specialization in data visualization.
